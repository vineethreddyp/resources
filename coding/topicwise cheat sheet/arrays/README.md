This will help you solve pretty much every Array problem you will find (7 effective techniques that got me the rank of 2021 on codeforces)

◘ Two-Pointer Technique

- Use two pointers to traverse the array from different ends or in different directions.
- Ideal for problems like finding pairs that meet certain conditions or reversing elements.

Sample Problems:

◘ Hashing

- Utilize a hash table to store and quickly retrieve element occurrences or frequencies.
- Great for problems where you need to check the presence of elements or manage counts efficiently.
- Helps in reducing time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) for certain problems.

◘ Sorting

- Begin by sorting the array to simplify operations that involve comparisons or range queries.
- Useful for problems like merging intervals, finding pairs, or identifying patterns.

◘ Sliding Window

- Slide a window of fixed or variable size across the array to find sums, products, or optimal values.
- Ideal for problems involving subarrays or contiguous segments where you need to find extremes.

◘ Dynamic Programming

- Break down the problem into overlapping subproblems and store results to avoid redundant calculations.
- Works well for optimization problems like finding the maximum sum or longest sequence.

◘ Greedy Algorithms

- Make the best local choice at each step with the goal of finding the global optimum.
- Suitable for optimization problems where each step can be solved independently.

Sample Problems:

◘ Divide and Conquer

- Divide the problem into smaller, independent subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine the results.
- Commonly used in sorting algorithms like merge sort and in finding optimal solutions.
